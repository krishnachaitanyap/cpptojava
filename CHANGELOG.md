## Release Notes

### Version 1.0.0
This is the initial release of the C++ to Java Migration CLI tool. It provides a complete solution for migrating legacy C++ monoliths to modern Java Spring Boot microservices using AI-powered code analysis and transformation.

**Key Features:**
- Intelligent C++ code parsing and analysis
- Vector-based semantic search through code
- AI-powered Java Spring Boot code generation
- Docker and deployment configuration generation
- Comprehensive CLI interface

**Requirements:**
- Node.js 18+
- OpenAI API key
- Pinecone API key and index

**Installation:**
```bash
npm install -g cpp-to-java-migrator
```

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Analyze C++ repository
cpp2java analyze -g https://github.com/owner/cpp-monolith

# Search for functionality
cpp2java search "authentication implementation"

# Transform to Java
cpp2java transform ServiceName

# Deploy service
cpp2java deploy ServiceName
```
